**smersh-cli** is a command line client for the [SMERSH API](https://github.com/CMEPW/Smersh) fully written in Python. 
It is an easy to use interactive command line made with CRUD in mind.

# Usage

To run smersh-cli, you simply have to invoke the `main.py` script with your SMERSH API url has single argument:

```bash
python main.py <smersh api url>
```

You will then be asked to enter your credentials before having an interactive command line interface (see below for an 
example).

## Commands

smersh-cli implements every single builtin `cmd2` command (see the [cmd2 documentation](https://cmd2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/builtin_commands.html) 
for more information about these commands). However, please think twice before using commands like `py` or `ipy` because
you can easily break something.

In addition to these commands, smersh-cli implements the following ones:

* show
* use
* assign
* save
* delete
* exit

Please note that every command is documented. The documentation can be shown with the `help` command.

### Commands and contexts

Some commands require a 'context' to be used. This is the case for the `assign`, `save` and `delete` commands. A context 
is used to tell the program about which object the operation you want to perform refers to. To change the context you 
need to use the `use` command. You can see at any time which context is active thanks to the prompt of the interactive 
command line. In order to exit the active context, use the `exit` command (**warning**: every unsaved modification will 
be lost).

# Installation

## Via Docker

This project includes a Dockerfile that you can build using the following command:

```bash
cd <project folder>
docker image build -t smershcli:v1.0 .
```

Once the image is built, you can simply run smersh-cli using the following command:

```bash
docker run -it <container id> <smersh api url>
```

## Via Pip

You can also install the latest release directly from PyPI using the following command:

```bash
pip install smersh_cli
```

## Manually

smersh-cli requires at least Python 3.5 because of the usage of typing (see [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) 
for more information). However, we recommend Python 3.8 to avoid using a hack to get the project working (see [issue #12](https://github.com/CMEPW/smersh-cli/issues/12)). 
If you have an older Python version, you will need to upgrade as we won't support any version below 3.5.

smersh-cli also depends on the following libraries:

* rich
* cmd2
* requests
* dataclasses_json
* pydantic
* importlib_metadata

If you have `setuptools` installed you can use the following command to install all dependencies and the package at once:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

You can then use smersh-cli simply by using the command `smersh-cli`.

# Internationalization

smersh-cli supports internationalization through the `gettext` library. This library will automatically detect and use 
your system language. If, however, you want to use (force) another language you can prefix the usual command by 
`LC_MESSAGES=<desired_two_letters_language_code>`.

Currently supported languages:

* English (default)
* Fran√ßais (100%)
